<h1>TetradDetection</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>High-throughout _S.cerevisiae_ tetrad image analysis pipeline. The pipeline relies on two deeplearning models for accurate detection of tetrads and triads followed by subsequent classification into corresponding tetrad types based on recombination (non-crossover, crossover). The pipeline takes input fluorescent images (mCerulean, tdTomato, YFP) and outputs calculated map distance, interference, non-dicjuntion and gene-conversion frequencies in an .xlsx file.</p>
